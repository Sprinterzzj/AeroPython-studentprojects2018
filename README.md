# MAE6226 (Spring 2018) - Student projects

Students should fork this repository, clone it to a local working directory, then add a folder for their project.
Name the folder in a way that identifies the student (pick your name, or a nickname we know).
The project report should be a single Jupyter notebook 
(include any dependencies, like figures, data), and submit via pull request.
The instructor will provide feedback as comments on the pull request, and merge the pull request
when the project is good!


**Please add all your files in one folder, named with your GitHub handle or last name.** And *please* do not include the notebook checkpoints in your commits (add the checkpoints folder to the ignore list).
